When constructing the windows form, 19 chessboards are created totally randomly and they are ready to solved by the algorithm :)


Top-right group box is used to make operations individually. Use the textbox below the buttons to choose the board you want to operate on. 
The Right table shows the statistics of each board and information calculated after they are solved.
  -Threat Count : The number of threats we are observing in between Quenns (It should be '0' to tell that the problem is solved.)
  -Number of Restarts: as a result of the somewhat greedy algorithm, sometimes it stucks (can not reduce the threat number) and compulsorily restarts the whole board and starts trying again.
  -Number of Displacement : The number of displacements made my the program to solve the board.
  -Total Run Time : How long it took to solve in terms of MS.
